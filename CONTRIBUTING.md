# Contributing to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MLGym</span>

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Development

We use ruff as linter/formatter and mypy for type checking.

1. Install the developmental dependencies

    `pip install -e .[dev]`
2. Install mypy and ruff extensions in your favorite code editor.

3. Here are some design choices to keep in mind before you start developing
   - **Type Hints**: All functions must have complete type annotations using native Python types (minimal imports from `typing` library)
   - **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all functions with proper Args/Returns/Raises sections
   - **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling with specific error types
   - **Path Handling**: Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path` for all file/path operations
   - **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines and use f-strings for string formatting
