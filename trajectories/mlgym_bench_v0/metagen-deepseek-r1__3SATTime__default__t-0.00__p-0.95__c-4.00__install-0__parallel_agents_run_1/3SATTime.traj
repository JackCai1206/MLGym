The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\ninsert:\n  docstring: inserts the given text after the specified line number in the open file. The text to insert is terminated by a line with only end_of_insert on it. All of the <text_to_add> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the insertion. If the system detects a syntax error, the insertion will not be executed.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference. Please do not include any DISCUSSION after your action.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\nYour goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the `validate` command, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms.\nOnce you have exhausted all possible solutions and cannot make progress, you can submit your final solution by using `submit` command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to understand the baseline script if available. This will give you an idea of one possible solution for the task and the baseline scores that you have to beat.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 1000 lines, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto <line_number> command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. You have a limited number of actions/steps you can take in the environment. The current step and remaining number of steps will given after every action. Use the remaining steps wisely. If you only have few remaining steps, it is better to submit a working solution then to keep trying.\n\n7. Your each action should take less than 1800 seconds to complete. If your action doesn't finish within the time limit, it will be interrupted.\n\n8. Validating your solution often, will give you a good idea of your progress so far and you will be able to adapt your strategy. Do not run the evaluation file on your own, use the `validate` function instead. If you run evaluation file yourself, your results won't be logged.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following task. Here's the task description:\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\nThe objective is to design a heuristic for a DPLL 3-SAT solver, aiming to select variables and assign boolean values in a way that achieves a solution in the LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME.\nSpecifically, the performance metric is to reduce solving time by reducing the number of recursive calls and backtracks in the solver.\nThe function should favor decisions that maximize clause satisfaction, minimize conflicts, and help detect conflicts early when possible. A heuristic function that consistently improves the solvers efficiency in finding solutions or proving unsatisfiability across various problem instances is the end goal.\n\nAn example heuristic is given to you in the `heuristic.py` file. You have to implement your changes without chaning the function name or signature.\n\nThe heuristic_fn has two blocks. Firstly, the variable selection which requires designing\nefficient heuristics to determine selection order to improve upon the objective.\nThe second block is to assign a value to the variable such that the number of backtracks, and\nhence the time to solve the formula is reduced.\nNote, that variables are absolute values of literals. The output of the heuristic function should be a single integer representing the next variable to be assigned and the boolean value to be assigned to the variable.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. You may find it helpful to prioritize certain factors (e.g., number of occurrences of a variable or variable frequency) by introducing weighting parameters.\n2. If you use transformations in the heuristic, include adjustable parameters (e.g., temperature, decay factor) to control their influence on variable selection. Each transformation parameter should be named clearly and set to ensure balanced impact within the heuristic.\n3. Ensure the type of each input variable is correctly specified.\n4. Most importantly, the heuristic function must be restricted to arguments accessible within the solver. Do not introduce new inputs or assume arguments that are not directly available in the SAT solver environment.\n5. Avoid contradictory heuristic factors; make sure that any prioritization logic aligns with the overall goal of minimizing backtracking and maximizing early clause satisfaction in terms of wall clock time.\n6. When conflicts arise, ensure that these factors are given precedence in variable selection. This means that any variable directly involved in potential conflicts or unit clauses should be prioritized above others to enhance the solvers efficiency in navigating challenging clauses.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to train a model to improve performance on this task. Your terminal session has started and you're in the workspace root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the file you need or create a new training script.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you have made, you can run your code. Your code should produce a valid submission artefact. Please follow the instructions in SUBMISSION FORMAT section above and adhere to the guidelines provided for generating submission artefacts. You can also look at the `evaluate.py` provided to you to see if you are following the correct format and naming scheme for your submission artefacts.\n\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT AND INSERT COMMANDs: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n(Current Step: 0, Remaining Steps: 50)\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /home/agent/workspace)\nbash-$",
