The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\ninsert:\n  docstring: inserts the given text after the specified line number in the open file.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference. Please do not include any DISCUSSION after your action.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\nYour goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the `validate` command, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms.\nOnce you have exhausted all possible solutions and cannot make progress, you can submit your final solution by using `submit` command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to understand the baseline script if available. This will give you an idea of one possible solution for the task and the baseline scores that you have to beat.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 1000 lines, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto <line_number> command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. You have a limited number of actions/steps you can take in the environment. The current step and remaining number of steps will given after every action. Use the remaining steps wisely. If you only have few remaining steps, it is better to submit a working solution then to keep trying.\n\n7. Your each action should take less than 1800 seconds to complete. If your action doesn't finish within the time limit, it will be interrupted.\n\n8. Validating your solution often, will give you a good idea of your progress so far and you will be able to adapt your strategy. Do not run the evaluation file on your own, use the `validate` function instead. If you run evaluation file yourself, your results won't be logged.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following task. Here's the task description:\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\nThis task revolves around training an RL agent for the Breakout MinAtar environment. Please find all the details about the Breakout MinAtar environment below.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nBreakout MinAtar is a simplified version of the classic Atari Breakout game. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must bounce a ball to break rows of bricks at the top. The ball travels only along diagonals and bounces off when hitting the paddle or walls. The game continues until the ball hits the bottom of the screen or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nOBSERVATION SPACE\nThe observation is a ndarray with shape (10, 10, 4) where the channels correspond to the following:\n\nChannel   Description\n  0       paddle - position of the player's paddle\n  1       ball - current position of the ball\n  2       trail - indicates the ball's direction of movement\n  3       brick - layout of the remaining bricks\n\nEach channel contains binary values (0 or 1) indicating presence/absence of the respective element.\n\nACTION SPACE\nThe action space consists of 3 discrete actions:\n\nNum    Action\n 0     no-op (no movement)\n 1     move paddle left\n 2     move paddle right\n\nTRANSITION DYNAMICS\n- The paddle moves left or right based on the chosen action\n- The ball moves diagonally and bounces off walls and the paddle\n- When the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed\n- When all bricks are cleared, a new set of three rows is added\n- The ball's direction is indicated by the trail channel\n\nREWARD\n- +1 reward for each brick broken\n- No negative rewards\n\nSTARTING STATE\n- Paddle starts at position 4\n- Ball starts at either (3,0) or (3,9) with corresponding diagonal direction\n- Three rows of bricks are initialized at the top (rows 1-3)\n\nEPISODE END\nThe episode ends if either of the following happens:\n1. Termination: The ball hits the bottom of the screen\n2. Truncation: The length of the episode reaches max_steps_in_episode (default: 1000)\n\nSTATE SPACE\nThe state consists of:\n- ball_y: vertical position of ball (0-9)\n- ball_x: horizontal position of ball (0-9)\n- ball_dir: direction of ball movement (0-3)\n- pos: paddle position (0-9)\n- brick_map: 10x10 binary map of bricks\n- strike: boolean indicating if ball hit something\n- last_y, last_x: previous ball position\n- time: current timestep\n- terminal: whether episode has ended\n\nGOAL:\nYou are given a PPO implementation using a Actor Critic network architecture.\nYour task is to improve performance of your agent in the given environment. You are encouraged to try different methods such as better RL algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, reward shaping etc.\n\nYou have to train 5 checkpoints with different model seeds. The code for training on 5 different seeds is given in the `src/train.py` file. If you are implementing a new algorithm, you only need to import the correct training function in place of `train_ppo` and keep everything the same.\n\nEach of your checkpoint will be evaluated on 64 randomly initialized environments using 5 different seeds. Final performance metric will be average reward across all seeds, environments and model checkpoints.\n\nIf a baseline is given, your task is to train a new model that improves performance on the given task as much as possible. If you fail to produce a valid submission artefact evaluation file will give you a score of 0.\n\nSUBMISSION FORMAT:\nFor this task, your code should save the trained model and it's config so that it can be evaluated later. Before evaluation, you workspace should include these two files:\n1. `checkpoints/`: Your checkpoints should be saved in a folder named `checkpoints` in the `workspace` folder. You can look at `src/train.py` to see how to save the model.\n2. `config.yaml`: This is the same config file that is being used to train the model.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE MODEL CLASS NAME. If you do that, evaluation will give you error and you won't be able to recover.\n2. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE EVALUATION SCRIPT. IT IS ONLY GIVEN TO YOU FOR YOUR REFERENCE.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to train a model to improve performance on this task. Your terminal session has started and you're in the workspace root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the file you need or create a new training script.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you have made, you can run your code. Your code should produce a valid submission artefact. Please follow the instructions in SUBMISSION FORMAT section above and adhere to the guidelines provided for generating submission artefacts. You can also look at the `evaluate.py` provided to you to see if you are following the correct format and naming scheme for your submission artefacts.\n\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT AND INSERT COMMANDs: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n(Current Step: 0, Remaining Steps: 50)\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /home/agent/workspace)\nbash-$",
