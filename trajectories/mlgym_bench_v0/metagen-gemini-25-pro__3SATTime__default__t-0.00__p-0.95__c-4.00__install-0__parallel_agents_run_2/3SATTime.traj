However, it got 3 fewer instances correct (23997 vs 24000), which is unexpected. This might indicate an issue in the fallback logic or the value assignment logic for certain edge cases, or perhaps the test set includes trivial cases where random guessing performs perfectly by chance.\n\nLet's refine the value assignment logic. Instead of just counting satisfied clauses, let's try a lookahead approach, mimicking what a solver might do. We can tentatively assign True and False, calculate the JWOS score for the *next* variable choice in each case, and pick the assignment that leads to a potentially better state (e.g., higher next JWOS score, potentially indicating more constrained variables). This is complex to implement fully within the heuristic function without simulating the solver's propagation.\n\nA simpler, yet potentially effective, value assignment heuristic is based on the literal counts in the *current* unsatisfied clauses. Assign the value that satisfies more literals in these clauses. This is similar to what I implemented, but let's double-check the logic for correctness and clarity.\n\nRe-examining the value assignment block (lines 72-110):\n- It iterates through *all* clauses.\n- It correctly skips clauses already satisfied by *other* variables.\n- It counts how many currently unsatisfied clauses would be satisfied by assigning True (satisfied_count_true) vs False (satisfied_count_false) to the chosen `variable`.\n- It picks the value with the higher count, defaulting to True.\n\nThis logic seems reasonable. The slight decrease in correctness might be due to the non-deterministic nature of SAT solving or specific instances where this heuristic makes a poor early choice compared to random.\n\nLet's consider another popular heuristic: VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum). VSIDS focuses on variables involved in recent conflicts. It increases scores for variables in conflict clauses and periodically decays all scores. This requires maintaining state (variable scores) across heuristic calls, which the current `heuristic_fn` signature supports implicitly if we use a global or class structure, but modifying the solver itself is outside the scope. We can, however, use the provided `conflict_count` and `assignment_history` or `level` to implement a simpler decay/activity mechanism.\n\nFor now, let's stick with JWOS but refine the value assignment slightly. Maybe defaulting to False when counts are equal could be tested?

This changes the tie-breaking behaviour slightly (it still defaults to True). Let me rephrase the logic to be clearer and make the tie-breaking explicitly default to False.\n\n",

I'll ensure the fallback cases return directly, and the main path calculates `variable` and `value` for the final return statement (which is outside the edit range).\n\nFirst, add the import.\n",

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference. Please do not include any DISCUSSION after your action.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\nYour goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the `validate` command, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms.\nOnce you have exhausted all possible solutions and cannot make progress, you can submit your final solution by using `submit` command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to understand the baseline script if available. This will give you an idea of one possible solution for the task and the baseline scores that you have to beat.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 1000 lines, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto <line_number> command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. You have a limited number of actions/steps you can take in the environment. The current step and remaining number of steps will given after every action. Use the remaining steps wisely. If you only have few remaining steps, it is better to submit a working solution then to keep trying.\n\n7. Your each action should take less than 1800 seconds to complete. If your action doesn't finish within the time limit, it will be interrupted.\n\n8. Validating your solution often, will give you a good idea of your progress so far and you will be able to adapt your strategy. Do not run the evaluation file on your own, use the `validate` function instead. If you run evaluation file yourself, your results won't be logged.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following task. Here's the task description:\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\nThe objective is to design a heuristic for a DPLL 3-SAT solver, aiming to select variables and assign boolean values in a way that achieves a solution in the LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME.\nSpecifically, the performance metric is to reduce solving time by reducing the number of recursive calls and backtracks in the solver.\nThe function should favor decisions that maximize clause satisfaction, minimize conflicts, and help detect conflicts early when possible. A heuristic function that consistently improves the solvers efficiency in finding solutions or proving unsatisfiability across various problem instances is the end goal.\n\nAn example heuristic is given to you in the `heuristic.py` file. You have to implement your changes without chaning the function name or signature.\n\nThe heuristic_fn has two blocks. Firstly, the variable selection which requires designing\nefficient heuristics to determine selection order to improve upon the objective.\nThe second block is to assign a value to the variable such that the number of backtracks, and\nhence the time to solve the formula is reduced.\nNote, that variables are absolute values of literals. The output of the heuristic function should be a single integer representing the next variable to be assigned and the boolean value to be assigned to the variable.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. You may find it helpful to prioritize certain factors (e.g., number of occurrences of a variable or variable frequency) by introducing weighting parameters.\n2. If you use transformations in the heuristic, include adjustable parameters (e.g., temperature, decay factor) to control their influence on variable selection. Each transformation parameter should be named clearly and set to ensure balanced impact within the heuristic.\n3. Ensure the type of each input variable is correctly specified.\n4. Most importantly, the heuristic function must be restricted to arguments accessible within the solver. Do not introduce new inputs or assume arguments that are not directly available in the SAT solver environment.\n5. Avoid contradictory heuristic factors; make sure that any prioritization logic aligns with the overall goal of minimizing backtracking and maximizing early clause satisfaction in terms of wall clock time.\n6. When conflicts arise, ensure that these factors are given precedence in variable selection. This means that any variable directly involved in potential conflicts or unit clauses should be prioritized above others to enhance the solvers efficiency in navigating challenging clauses.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to train a model to improve performance on this task. Your terminal session has started and you're in the workspace root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the file you need or create a new training script.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you have made, you can run your code. Your code should produce a valid submission artefact. Please follow the instructions in SUBMISSION FORMAT section above and adhere to the guidelines provided for generating submission artefacts. You can also look at the `evaluate.py` provided to you to see if you are following the correct format and naming scheme for your submission artefacts.\n\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT AND INSERT COMMANDs: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n(Current Step: 0, Remaining Steps: 50)\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /home/agent/workspace)\nbash-$",

However, it got 3 fewer instances correct (23997 vs 24000), which is unexpected. This might indicate an issue in the fallback logic or the value assignment logic for certain edge cases, or perhaps the test set includes trivial cases where random guessing performs perfectly by chance.\n\nLet's refine the value assignment logic. Instead of just counting satisfied clauses, let's try a lookahead approach, mimicking what a solver might do. We can tentatively assign True and False, calculate the JWOS score for the *next* variable choice in each case, and pick the assignment that leads to a potentially better state (e.g., higher next JWOS score, potentially indicating more constrained variables). This is complex to implement fully within the heuristic function without simulating the solver's propagation.\n\nA simpler, yet potentially effective, value assignment heuristic is based on the literal counts in the *current* unsatisfied clauses. Assign the value that satisfies more literals in these clauses. This is similar to what I implemented, but let's double-check the logic for correctness and clarity.\n\nRe-examining the value assignment block (lines 72-110):\n- It iterates through *all* clauses.\n- It correctly skips clauses already satisfied by *other* variables.\n- It counts how many currently unsatisfied clauses would be satisfied by assigning True (satisfied_count_true) vs False (satisfied_count_false) to the chosen `variable`.\n- It picks the value with the higher count, defaulting to True.\n\nThis logic seems reasonable. The slight decrease in correctness might be due to the non-deterministic nature of SAT solving or specific instances where this heuristic makes a poor early choice compared to random.\n\nLet's consider another popular heuristic: VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum). VSIDS focuses on variables involved in recent conflicts. It increases scores for variables in conflict clauses and periodically decays all scores. This requires maintaining state (variable scores) across heuristic calls, which the current `heuristic_fn` signature supports implicitly if we use a global or class structure, but modifying the solver itself is outside the scope. We can, however, use the provided `conflict_count` and `assignment_history` or `level` to implement a simpler decay/activity mechanism.\n\nFor now, let's stick with JWOS but refine the value assignment slightly. Maybe defaulting to False when counts are equal could be tested? Or, consider the polarity: count the occurrences of `+variable` and `-variable` in the active clauses and pick the value corresponding to the more frequent literal.\n\nLet's try the polarity count method for value assignment.\n```bash\nedit 72:112\n    # Value Assignment: Choose the value based on literal occurrences in active clauses.\n    positive_literal = variable\n    negative_literal = -variable\n    positive_occurrences = 0\n    negative_occurrences = 0\n\n    # Iterate through clauses again, focusing on active (unsatisfied) ones containing the variable\n    for clause in clauses:\n        is_satisfied_by_other = False\n        contains_positive = False\n        contains_negative = False\n        is_unassigned = False # Track if clause contains unassigned lits other than variable\n\n        for lit in clause:\n            var = abs(lit)\n            if var in assignments:\n                if assignments[var] == (lit > 0):\n                    is_satisfied_by_other = True\n                    break # Clause already satisfied\n            else:\n                # Unassigned literal\n                if var == variable:\n                    if lit == positive_literal:\n                        contains_positive = True\n                    elif lit == negative_literal:\n                        contains_negative = True\n                else:\n                    is_unassigned = True # Contains other unassigned lits\n\n        if is_satisfied_by_other:\n            continue # Skip satisfied clauses\n\n        # Consider only clauses that are not yet satisfied and contain the variable\n        if contains_positive:\n            positive_occurrences += 1\n        if contains_negative:\n            negative_occurrences += 1\n\n    # Choose the value corresponding to the more frequent literal in active clauses\n    # Default to True in case of a tie.

I changed the value assignment logic on line 111 to default to True only if positive occurrences are greater than *or equal* to negative occurrences.

However, we can implement a simplified version using the provided `conflict_count`.\n\nLet's try a hybrid approach:\n1.  Calculate JWOS scores as before (using effective length).\n2.  If `conflict_count` is high (e.g., > some threshold, or maybe just > 0), prioritize variables involved in *recent* conflicts. The `assignment_history` might give clues about recent decisions, but it doesn't directly tell us which variables were in the conflict clause that led to the backtrack. The `level` indicates the decision level, higher levels mean more recent decisions before backtracking. This information isn't directly usable for VSIDS without more solver internals.\n3.  A simpler proxy: use the JWOS score but add a bonus based on the overall `conflict_count`.

Replace only the core logic inside the function, from line 17 (after `random.seed(10)`) up to line 112 (just before the final `return variable, value`), with the carefully indented MOMs code. I'll ensure the fallback cases return directly, and the main path calculates `variable` and `value` for the final return statement (which is outside the edit range).\n\nFirst, add the import.\n",
