Parser module for handling model outputs in the MLGym framework.

This module provides a collection of parser classes that handle different formats
of model outputs. Each parser is responsible for extracting thoughts and actions
from model responses in specific formats (JSON, XML, markdown code blocks, etc.).
The module supports extensible parsing through a registry pattern.

The error in `evaluate.py` occurs because the import statement for `heuristic_fn` assumes that `heuristic.py` is a package, which is not the case. Since `heuristic.py` is a standalone script, we should modify the import statement to import the function        
directly from the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
**Discussion:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1. **Modify Import Statement:** Change the import statement in `evaluate.py` to import `heuristic_fn` directly from the `heuristic` script, rather than as a package.                                                                                               
2. **Testing Integration:** After modifying the import, we should be able to run `evaluate.py` again to validate the updated heuristic function.                                                                                                                    
3. **Check for Errors:** After running the evaluation, check the output for any discrepancies or errors to ensure that everything is working as expected.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Let's update the `evaluate.py` file to correctly import the `heuristic_fn` function.
